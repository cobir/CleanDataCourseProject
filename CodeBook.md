The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals ("body acceleration signal" and "gravity acceleration signal") using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals ("linear jerk of the Body acceleration signal" and "angular jerk of the Body acceleration signal"). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm:
 ( "Magnitude of the body acceleration signal"
   "Magnitude of the gravity acceleration signal"
   "Magnitude of the linear jerk of the Body acceleration signal"
   "Magnitude of the body gyroscope signal"
   "Magnitude of the angular jerk of the Body acceleration signal")

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals  ( features named "FFT of")

For these signals the Mean and Standard Deviation variables were estimated.

For each feature named below the values is the average of the measurement over all the values of the (subject, action) pair.
